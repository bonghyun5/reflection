Weekly Reflection Sep 21

This week was different from all other weeks of classes we have had before. On both days, we had guest lecturers come in to talk to us about their experiences in their respective field. They specialized in their field, and it was very interesting to hear about their experiences. Furthermore, it was even more engaging to hear about how Statistics and data science are involved in a seemingly disconnected fields of research. For example, I have learned that discovering the right habitat for frogs was more of a data science / statistical problem, rather than a biological one. My computer science professor once told us that problems in the world are increasingly becoming a statistical one. So much data are generated everyday, and the process of using these data become a significant challenge for the academic world.
