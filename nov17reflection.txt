stat 157 Nov16 Reflection

The reflection this week entails my thought on how the class is going. At the current rate, I feel that as an analyzer, we are kinda lost on what we exactly have to do. I feel that the question we are facing is pretty ambiguous. It's a type of question that has not been answered by the general academic body, so it seems pretty difficult for us to think out a solution in such a short amount of time.
