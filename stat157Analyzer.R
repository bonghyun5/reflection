REflection Nov 30

This week has been rather short due to Holidays.

On Tuesday, we had the opportunity to talk to the creator of iPhyton notebook. It was an interesting experience to have one of the creators of a framework that we are using in class to talk directly to us. It really put our work into perspective. The amount of work and effort that probably went into making this framework is unimaginable. I command the creator for his effort in making this open source software for everyone to use.
