This week in class, we had hands-on experience working with the softwares and tools that we will be utilizing for the rest of the semester. To be completely honest, this week was sort of a disaster. Too many people in class simply could not follow the steps outlined, and there were too much variability in terms of people's hardware. Additionally, the steps were definitely not clearly outlined. Even for me, who is a computer science major and have experience installing virtual box, it was hard to follow the little instructions given in class. Add it with the fact that the instructions were verbal, it is understandable why so many people were unable to follow the instructions.

On Thursday, we spent the entire day doing pros and cons of what was happening. I don't think this is a productive use of our class time at all. We should have instead given pros and cons as a homework, and actually learned something useful in class. Overall, I'm sort of disappointed in the class. I haven't really learned anything useful yet, and the class just seems very unorganized and unstructured.
