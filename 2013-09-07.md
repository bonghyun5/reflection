For me, this week's materials were mostly review for me. As a CS and Stats double major, I have used most of the technologies taught to us this week. I have been using Git ever since my Sophomore year where I had to use it for my CS61C class for version control mechanism. Additionally, I have used Heroku and Git together to build couple of my websites. I especially like using Heroku and Git since it enables me to host websites for free. 

In my internship this summer, I have extensively used Virtual Box. I have learned that by using Virtual Box, I was able to emulate the exact environment that will be used when running my code. This allowed me to develop my codes in a practical environment which allowed any additional problems later on. Overall, this class will be a review for me, but at the same time I will be able reinforce what I have learned.
