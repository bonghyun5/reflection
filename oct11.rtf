\f0\fs24 \cf0 This week, we did couple presentations on the work we did over the weekend. Although I wasn't there for the presentation, I did make contribution to the group by providing detailed analysis of the data we had. Overall, the project was an okay one. It was good in that we were finally given a chance to do something, but it wasn't so useful in that the work we did did not pertain to anything we learned in class. }
